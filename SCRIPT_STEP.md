    - Confirm portable folder behavior.

11. Tag insertion assistance
    - Continue from `Step11-section1`.
    - Refine tag insertion menus and dictionary-backed snippets.
    - Show file-format-specific tag snippets from the editor context menu.
    - Support mouse selection and keyboard selection with arrow keys plus Enter.
    - Consider automatic snippet set switching by extension, such as `.html`, `.md`, and `.wp.html`.

## Step11-section1 Tag Insertion Entry

Completed:

- Added the `Edit` menu entry `Insert Tag` / `タグ挿入`.
- Added tag insertion groups:
  - HTML
  - Markdown
  - WordPress HTML
- Added insertion templates that support:
  - `{selection}` for wrapping selected text.
  - `{cursor}` for placing the cursor after insertion.
- Added parameter hints through menu action `statusTip` and `toolTip`.
- Moved snippet data to local JSON dictionaries:
  - `dictionarys/html_dict.json`
  - `dictionarys/markdown_dict.json`
  - `dictionarys/wordpress_html_dict.json`
- Added common Markdown snippets:
  - headings, bold, italic, links, images, inline code, fenced code blocks, quote, lists, horizontal rule.
  - language-specific fenced code blocks for Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, PowerShell, Bash, and SQL.
- Added commonly used WordPress HTML snippets:
  - paragraph, headings, list, quote, code, preformatted, custom HTML code box, separator, spacer, and button.
  - `wp:code` uses `<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>...</code></pre>`.
  - `wp:html` custom code box includes the styled `<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>...</code></pre>` wrapper.
- Added common HTML snippets:
  - paragraph, headings, links, image, figure, div, span, lists, inline code, and pre/code block.
  - HTML hints describe common parameters such as `href`, `src`, `alt`, `class`, `id`, `data-*`, `target`, `rel`, `start`, `reversed`, and `type`.

Follow-up candidates:

1. Right-click tag insertion
   - Add `タグ挿入` to the editor context menu.
   - Reuse the same snippet groups as the menu bar.
   - Keep selected text wrapping behavior identical.

2. Menu hierarchy refinement
   - Split large groups into submenus such as:
     - HTML: Basic, Link/Image, Lists, Code, Layout.
     - Markdown: Text, Link/Image, Code, Lists.
     - WordPress HTML: Text, Layout, Code, Utility.

3. File extension based ordering
   - Prefer Markdown snippets for `.md`.
   - Prefer HTML snippets for `.html`.
   - Prefer WordPress HTML snippets for `.wp.html`.
   - Keep manual access to all groups even when one group is prioritized.

4. Dictionary JSON validation
   - Validate required keys: `label_key`, `hint_key`, and `template`.
   - Detect missing translation keys.
   - Detect missing or duplicated `{cursor}` when cursor placement is expected.
   - Detect unknown placeholders.
   - Detect empty labels, hints, or templates.

5. Richer parameter hints
   - Consider adding structured `parameters` arrays to JSON.
   - Generate hover text from structured parameter definitions.
   - This can later support linting or inline assistance for tag attributes.

6. Snippet search / keyboard picker
   - Add a small searchable popup for users who prefer typing tag names.
   - Support arrow keys plus Enter.
   - Keep menu insertion and popup insertion backed by the same JSON data.

7. Attribute-aware insertion
   - For common attributes such as `class`, `id`, `href`, `src`, and `alt`, consider optional prompt or placeholder navigation.
   - Keep the current direct insertion as the fast path.

## Validation Commands

Use the project virtual environment:

```powershell
"D:\Dev\venvs\venv_txt_edit312\Scripts\python.exe" -m ruff check .
"D:\Dev\venvs\venv_txt_edit312\Scripts\python.exe" -m pyright
"D:\Dev\venvs\venv_txt_edit312\Scripts\python.exe" -m pytest
```

## Project Principles

- Keep the app portable.
- Do not use the Windows Registry.
- Do not require administrator privileges.
- Store settings locally.
- Keep regex usable for non-programmers.
- Do not modify text during search.
- Modify text only when the user explicitly runs Replace or Replace All.
- Keep English and Japanese help aligned in meaning.
